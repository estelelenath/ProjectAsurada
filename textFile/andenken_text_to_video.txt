sunset, a man, remind of old days, ex-girlfriend, love, sad, and longing, I am still missing you

A man walks alone again on a sunset autumn evening down the street he once walked with his girlfriend.

A man accidentally walked down the street he used to walk with his girlfriend.
It was a late autumn evening.
It seemed that she was standing behind her for some reason, so I looked behind her involuntarily.
But he came to the realization that she was no longer there.

He still misses her.
